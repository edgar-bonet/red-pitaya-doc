Apart from the graph, the user interface consists of six areas:

    1. **Top settings menu** - Includes basic functionality like Settings, Exporting data, Autoscale and Running/Stopping the measurements.
    #. **Channel and trigger settings** - This menu provides control over inputs and outputs, triggers, guides, and measurements.
    #. **Axis control panel** - By pressing the horizontal ± buttons, the time axis (X axis) scale is changed. The vertical ± buttons change the amplitude axis (Y axis) and thus the displayed voltage range of the signal.
    #. **Time and trigger info** - Displays the current time scale per division, trigger settings (time frame, trigger, zero point of the X-axis) and sampling rate.
    #. **Channel amplitude scale** - Indicates the Y axis scale for all displayed channels.
    #. **Measurements display** - Displays the results of performed measurements.

1. Top settings menu
=====================

Provides control over the Oscilloscope application. The blue question mark leads to this exact documentation page.

.. figure:: img/osc_top_menu.png
    :width: 800

Settings
----------

The settings menu provides control over the application settings:

- **Save** - Saves the current Oscilloscope and Signal Generator settings under the specified name. The settings are saved in the SD card's local storage (board model specific).
- **Reset** - Resets all Oscilloscope and Signal Generator settings to default versions.
- **Recall** (user-specified name) - Recalls the previously saved Oscilloscope and Signal Generator settings. Each saved setting is listed in the drop-down menu, and the user can select the desired one.

Menu
-----

Includes the following settings:

- **ARB Manager** - Goes directly to the :ref:`Arbitrary Waveform Manager application <arb_manager_app>`, where a custom waveform can be uploaded for generation.
- **Sys Info** - When checked, the Oscilloscope Application displays System information like, FPS, CPU Load, etc. in the bottom left corner of the application.
- **IN/E2** - When checked, displays the voltages from slow analog inputs of the E2 connector.
- **ADC 16 bit** - When checked, the oscilloscope will display the data in 16-bit resolution, provided that the decimation factor is sufficiently high (available on boards with non-16-bit native resolution).
- **Ext. Clock** (only SIGNALlab 250-12) - Enables the External Clock synchronisation for the SIGNALlab. For more info see the chapter below.


External reference clock (only SIGNALlab 250-12)
-------------------------------------------------

The external reference clock input can be enabled through the settings menu. Once enabled, its status is displayed in the main interface. The "green" status indicates that the sampling clock is locked to the external reference clock.

|

Interpolation
-------------

Controls how the sampled data points are rendered between each other on screen. When **disabled** (default), individual samples are shown directly as discrete points. When enabled, samples are connected using one of the following algorithms:

1. **Linear** — straight lines between samples.
2. **B-Spline** — smooth curve fitting.
3. **Catmull-Rom** — smooth curve that passes exactly through each sample point.
4. **Lanczos** — high-quality reconstruction filter.

|

Trace Mode
----------

When **Trace Mode** is enabled, historical waveform data is retained on the screen as new data arrives, creating a persistence display similar to analog oscilloscopes. This allows visualisation of signal variations and rare events over time.

The following options are available:

-   **Fast mode:** Optimises the trace rendering for high data throughput.
-   **Inverted opacity:** Reverses the opacity of the trace, so older data appears brighter and newer data appears dimmer.
-   **Trace colour selection:** Select the colour scheme used to represent the density of data points — frequently occurring values appear in one colour while rare values appear in another.

Burst Mode
-----------

Configure the output to operate in burst mode. Frequency, amplitude, and other settings are kept from the Continuous mode (the higher menu). The burst mode will stay active until turned OFF or the settings are RESET to defaults. 
The burst signal stops generating once all bursts are generated. The status of burst mode is displayed by the corresponding light in the output channel settings.

.. figure:: img/gen_outputs_burst.png
    :height: 300

- **ON** - Turns the burst mode ON/OFF.
- **Number of periods (NCYC)** - Number of signal periods in one burst. Also known as Number of Cycles (NCYC).
- **Repetitions (NOR)** - Number of repeated bursts. Also known as Number Of Repetitions (NOR).
- **REPETITIONS INF** - When selected, the burst signals are repeated indefinitely.
- **Period (μs)** - Period between the start of the first burst and the start of the next burst (can be set to 0).
- **Last value** - The output signal will remain at the ``last value`` of the burst signal after the last burst repetition is generated. Otherwise, the output signal will return to the GND.
- **Use last sample** - When selected, the output signal will remain at the last sample of the burst signal after the last burst repetition is generated (Last value is ignored).
- **Trig Gen** - Manually trigger the signal generator.


Sweep Mode
-----------

Configure the output to operate in sweep mode. All other settings, except frequency are kept from the Continuous mode (the higher menu). The sweep mode will stay active until turned OFF or the settings are RESET to defaults.
Turning OFF the channel will not turn OFF the sweep mode, but it will stop generating the sweep signal. The status of sweep mode is displayed by the corresponding light in the output channel settings.

.. figure:: img/gen_outputs_sweep.png
    :height: 300

- **Start Freq (Hz)** - Sweep start frequency in Hertz.
- **End Freq (Hz)** - Sweep end/stop frequency in Hertz.
- **Duration (μs)** - Sweep duration in microseconds. When operating in UP-DOWN direction, this is applies to both directions (if set to 1000 ms, the sweep will take 1000 ms in the UP direction and then 1000 ms in the DOWN direction).
- **Sweep Mode** - Either LINEAR or LOG.
- **Sweep Dir** - Sweep direction. Either NORMAL or UP-DOWN.
- **Repetitions (NOR)** - Number of repeated sweeps. Also known as Number Of Repetitions (NOR).
- **REPETITIONS INF** - When selected, the sweep signals are repeated indefinitely.

4. Trigger
===========

.. figure:: img/osc_trigger.png
    :width: 250

The trigger is used to enable the scope to display changing waveforms on the scope screen in a steady fashion. Here are the available settings:

    - **Source** - The trigger source can be any input channel (IN1, IN2 or IN3, IN4 (4-Input boards only)) or an external source.
    - **Edge** - During the acquisition, signal amplitude can cross the trigger level from a higher value to a lower one (falling) or vice versa (rising). The edge setting determines the first part of the trigger condition.
    - **Level/V** - The trigger level value is used to determine at which value of signal amplitude the trigger condition is satisfied. The trigger level is the second part of the trigger condition.
    - **Hysteresis/V** - Minimal jump in voltage around the trigger level that can create another trigger condition. Used to prevent the noise from creating additional triggers if the signal amplitude is close to the trigger level.
    - **Mode** - Oscilloscope trigger mode

        -   **Auto** - Trigger state and conditions are disregarded. Signal acquisition and signal trace re-plotting are executed in a repetitive (continuous) manner. This is the default setting.
        -   **Normal** - The acquisition (trace re-plotting) is executed only if the trigger condition is satisfied. In other words, the input signal needs to satisfy the trigger condition to be acquired and (re)plotted by the Oscilloscope.
        -   **Single** - After trigger condition is satisfied by the observed signal, the acquisition is executed only once, and trace re-plotting is stopped regardless of the trigger states.

    - **External Trigger Debouncer (μs)** - Length of the debounce filter for the external trigger. The debounce filter is used to prevent false triggering due to noise on the external trigger input. The debounce filter is applied only when the external trigger source is selected.
    - **Time offset/ms** - Trigger time offset. This setting moves the time-offset cursor on the screen. Determines the trigger location on the Oscilloscope screen.
    - **Reset** - Resets time offset back to 0 ms (middle of screen).

The Source parameter defines the source used for this purpose. With the IN1, IN2, IN3, or IN4, the signal at the respective input is selected; with the EXT, you can invoke the trigger from outside through:

* DIO0_P pin on the :ref:`E1 connector <E1_gen2>`.
* BNC connector on the front panel (only SIGNALlab 250-12).

The trigger condition is composed of both the trigger level and the trigger edge. When both conditions are satisfied, the acquisition is executed, and the signal is plotted on the screen.

5. Math
========

.. figure:: img/Slika_08_OSC.png
    :width: 1000

Among the more interesting features of a digital oscilloscope is the "math" channel. The available settings are the following:

    -   **\+** Add the selected channels.
    -   **\-** Subtract the selected channels.
    -   **\*** Multiply selected channels.
    -   **ABS** Give an absolute value of the selected signal.
    -   **dy/dt** Give a time derivation of the selected signal.
    -   **ydt** Give a time integration of the selected signal.
    -   **INVERT** Invert the signal.

|

6. Out/E2
===========

Control the voltage on the slow analog outputs. Type in the value in Volts into the field labeled by the slow analog output number.

.. figure:: img/Slika_11_OSC_E2.png
    :width: 250

|

7. Cursor
==========

This feature enables the user to easily get the data of relevant basic measurements, such as signal period, amplitude, time delay, amplitude difference between two points, time difference between two points, etc. The cursors can be moved by clicking and dragging them on the screen.

.. figure:: img/Slika_09_OSC.png
    :width: 1000

|

8. Navigate
===========

When you have a lot of data to analyse, it is very important to get through it easily. Navigate left and right by 
dragging the data where you want and effortlessly zooming in and out by using your mouse scroll wheel.

.. figure:: img/Slika_04_OSC.png
    :width: 1000

.. tip::

    -   **Shift + scroll wheel** while a channel is selected scales the signal along the **Y-axis** (voltage scale) for that channel only.
    -   **Clicking a cursor** on the left side of the screen sets that channel as the **active channel**.

|

9. Measurements
===============

The menu can be found under the **MEAS** button. Here you can select up to 4 measured values in total and then provide the corresponding values. In the Operator field, select the desired measurement and then set the signal from which channel the value should be taken. One-click on DONE shows the value at the bottom of the channel settings. You may choose among the following:

    -   **P2P** - The difference between the lowest and the highest measured voltage value.
    -   **MEAN** - The signal's calculated average.
    -   **MAX** - The maximum voltage value measured.
    -   **MIN** - The lowest voltage value measured.
    -   **RMS** - The calculated RMS (root mean square) of the signal.
    -   **DUTY CYCLE** - The signal's duty cycle (ratio of the pulse duration and period length).
    -   **PERIOD** - Displays the period length, the time length of vibration.
    -   **FREQ** - The frequency of the signal.

The measurements are removed by clicking on the specific measurement from the list.
